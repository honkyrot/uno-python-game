# UNO game
Created in Python 3.11.
Requires package Pytest for test cases to work.

This project was a joint collaboration with Honkyrot/myself and my software development classmates.
This version is a fork of that project for personal use, so it's not the same as the original.
We essentially had 3 teams working on different parts of the game, and I was in charge of merging and fixing the code.
That was finished back in December of 2022, even then there were still some bugs in the code and I just called it quits.

So here I am, trying to fix the bugs and make the game playable again after someone decided to do a pull request,
and realizing that this repository was still messy since I left it. So now hopefully it's a bit more organized.

bugs may still exist in the code, unfortunately.

### How to run
1. Download/clone the repository
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory
3. With Python, run the script "UNO_Gameplay.py" to start the game.
